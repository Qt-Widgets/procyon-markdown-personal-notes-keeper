# Procyon

Procyon is personal note-keeping application. It is heavily inspired by Evernote and Microsoft OneNote and Google Keep but lacks the [fatal flow](http://www.drdobbs.com/windows/a-brief-history-of-windows-programming-r/225701475) of those :). It also lacks many of their abilities, of course, to be honest.

Procyon manages a set of text notes storing them in a single SQLite database. It doesn't use its own server, and to share the database between your machines, you are free to choose a favored sync service, e.g., Dropbox or Google Drive.

It supports syntax highlighting for some programming languages and custom highlighter for general working notes.
